# Responsive-restaurant-menu
Hello; I made a restaurant menu using HTML, CSS and Javascript. If the information of the food is entered into the objects in the array in the Javascript part, it takes its place in its own category, if any, and if it does not exist, it automatically takes its place after the new category button is created.
